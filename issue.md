# Deployment Issue Analysis

## Problem Description
The application is currently not deployable due to several critical issues:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Username is hardcoded in `config.py`
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: No `.env` file for sensitive data
3. **Google Colab Dependencies**: The code relies on `google.colab` for secret management, which is not suitable for production
4. **Authentication Flow**: The current authentication flow is not secure for deployment
5. **Missing Dependencies**: Some required packages are not listed in `requirements.txt`

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Security Issues**:
   - Username is hardcoded in `config.py`
   - Password is being fetched from Google Colab secrets, which won't work outside Colab
   - No proper environment variable management

2. **Architectural Issues**:
   - The application is tightly coupled with Google Colab's environment
   - Missing proper error handling for production scenarios
   - No clear separation between development and production configurations

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Some required packages are missing from `requirements.txt`
   - No version pinning for all dependencies

## Impact
- The application cannot be deployed in a production environment
- Security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded credentials
- Poor user experience due to Google Colab dependencies
- Difficult to maintain and scale
